“What is JSON and how to use it?”

After 6 months: 10K+ visitors/month with consistent SEO and content.


















########################################## why ranking very low #####################################################


Thanks, that data is very helpful. Let's break it down and diagnose what's happening.

📊 Google Search Console Data (Your Site)
Keyword	Clicks	Impressions
online format json	0	2
format json online	0	2
formatador json online	0	1

🔍 What This Means:
You're barely appearing in Google search results (only 5 impressions total).

You’ve not ranked high enough (probably page 3 or beyond) for these keywords.

No clicks means users aren’t seeing your site in top positions (like top 5 results).

You’re also not targeting enough keyword variations yet.

✅ What You Need to Do Now
✅ 1. Target Long-Tail, Low Competition Keywords
Try keywords like:

"free json formatter without ads"

"online json formatter dark mode"

"json formatter for large files"

"fast json pretty print online"

"how to format json using browser"

These have less competition than broad terms like “format json online”.

✅ 2. Create Supporting Blog Posts
Each of these blog posts can help you rank for long-tail keywords:

✅ "Why Use a JSON Formatter Instead of a Code Editor?"

✅ "Best JSON Formatter for Frontend Developers"

✅ "How to Beautify JSON on Mobile Devices"

✅ "Top 3 JSON Formatters That Respect Your Privacy"

✅ "JSON Validator vs Formatter: What's the Difference?"

This will:

Increase indexed pages

Bring in more search queries

Show Google you're active and building authority

✅ 3. Improve Click-Through with Titles & Meta Descriptions
Even if you're not on Page 1 yet, your title and meta description can increase CTR when you do start ranking.

Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<title>Free Online JSON Formatter & Beautifier | No Ads</title>
<meta name="description" content="Instantly format and beautify your JSON online. Fast, private, and easy to use. No ads or distractions.">
✅ 4. Build Backlinks and Mentions
Post about your tool in:

Reddit (r/javascript, r/webdev)

Hacker News (show your project)

Dev.to (write dev-focused content with a link)

Twitter/X (tag dev influencers)

Quora/Stack Overflow (only if contextually relevant)

✅ 5. Track Weekly Changes
After posting content and promoting it:

Check GSC weekly

Track new impressions and clicks

Celebrate progress even if slow — SEO takes 2–3 months for new sites to start climbing

🔄 Want a Weekly Action Plan?
If you’d like, I can create a weekly content and promotion schedule for the next month, specifically designed to:

Increase impressions

Target low-competition keywords

Promote in the right places
